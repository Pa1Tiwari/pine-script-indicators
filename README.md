# Ultimate Multi-Timeframe Multi-Averages

## Description
The **Ultimate Multi-Timeframe Multi-Averages** indicator is a powerful tool for tracking multiple moving averages across different timeframes. It allows traders to overlay **EMA, SMA, SMMA, WMA, and VWMA** from higher or lower timeframes onto any chart. This is particularly useful for identifying broader trend directions, support/resistance levels, and crossovers without switching timeframes.

The script supports two fully customizable modules with three averages each, giving you deep control over your technical analysis setup.
