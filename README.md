# Fair Value Gap (FVG) Indicator  

## Description  
This Pine Script indicator automatically detects and highlights **Fair Value Gaps (FVGs)** on the chart.  
It identifies both **bullish** and **bearish** FVGs using swing-based logic and dynamically extends the gaps until they are filled.  
The script includes advanced filtering such as **gap size thresholds**, **swing point validation**, and an optional **09:15 candle-based calculation** (useful for Indian markets).  

FVGs are widely used in institutional trading concepts to identify areas where price may return to rebalance liquidity.
